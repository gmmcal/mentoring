            Hello! My name is Gustavo Cunha. I have almost 20 years of
            experience developing all sorts of web-based software. I strongly
            believe that teaching is the best way to learn, so I want to
            dedicate some of my time to teach you something and learn something
            from you.

          <h2>What we can talk about</h2>
          <p>
            In order for everything work well and we can learn together, we need
            to setup some ground rules on what you can expect from me.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              I'm highly specialized on backend development and have some
              knowledge on frontend and devops tools. I mostly know things about
              Ruby, Python and PHP. Since programming languages seems alike, I
              can understand a bit of some others.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>There is no such thing as a stupid question</strong>. Feel
              free to ask anything and I'll try my best to help you.
            </li>
            <li>
              I can try to code review your code. For that, please send a link
              for your repository/(pull|merge) request during your appointment
              and be clear that your want a code-review session. This link has
              to be publicly accessible.
            </li>
            <li>
              I can help you prepare for interviews. I've done this for
              companies already. I can't guarantee that you will succeed your
              job application (but I do hope you will).
            </li>
            <li>
              I can check your CV and give you tips on how to improve. Please,
              send a PDF link of your CV and we can talk about it. This link has
              to be publicly accessible.
            </li>
            <li>
              I can give you tips on next steps on your career and help you
              decrypt what the market is looking for.
            </li>
            <li>
              Don't expect I know everything. I'm here to help you, but also to
              learn from you.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>What we can't talk about</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              I will not pair program with you. The idea is to talk about
              development career, not write code along with you. Pair
              programming takes much more time and requires previous domain
              knowledge that I might not have enough.
            </li>
            <li>
              I will not review code that is intended to be submitted for a job
              application. This is not fair to other applicants. If I suspect
              this is the intention, I will stop the session.
            </li>
            <li>
              Due to ethical reasons, I will not review code that is held on
              private repositories nor owned by private companies, unless they
              are open sourced.

          <h2>Commitment Fee</h2>
          <p>
            I've organized a few events on my life, and one thing I learned is
            that anything that is given for free lacks commitment from the
            consumer party. To avoid this problem, I decided to place what I
            call a Commitment Fee.
          </p>
          <h4>The Amount</h4>
          <p>
            The amount I charge for this is <strong>&euro;10,00</strong> (ten
            euros) for one session of 30 minutes for one person. Please, do not
            book multiple people for one session. This amount is non-refundable,
            in accordance to <a href="#refund">Refund Policy</a>.

          <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>I will not process refunds for no-shows.</li>
            <li>
              If you can't attend a session, please let me know with at least 24
              hours before your session. I will allow you to book a new time
              free of charge.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can postpone 1 time per session payment. If you reschedule one
              session and can't make it, I will not reschedule nor refund.
            </li>
            <li>
              If <strong>I</strong> need to postpone the session, you will be
              allowed to reschedule <strong>two</strong> sessions instead of
              <strong>one</strong>, with no extra costs.
            </li>
            <li>
              You will probably receive an email from Calendly after your
              booking. Please, do not use the cancel nor reschedule links
              provided on the email (if any) without my express approval.
            </li>
            <li>
              Any changes for this Refund Policy will be effective on the day
              the code is published on
              <a

                >Github</a
              >. If your booking was done before that, you will not be eligible
              for it, regardless if you benefit or not by the change. New
              policies do not apply for rescheduling.

          <h2>Tech Minority Commitment</h2>
          <p>
            If you belong to any group that is part of a tech minority, like
            LGBTQA+, woman, people of color, low-income, people with any
            disabilities, etc, your fee will can refunded after the session, if
            you want, according to the following criteria:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>I have 3 business days to confirm the refund.</li>
            <li>
              I will try to refund you in full minus Wise Transfer
              Fees<sup>*</sup>. I will send you a proof of the transfer via
              email.
            </li>
            <li>
              Whenever possible, I will try to absorb the fees and return 100%
              of the Commitment Fee. There is no guarantee that this will
              happen, unfortunately.
            </li>
            <li>
              Refunds will only be processed after the session. No-shows and
              reschedule policy still applies to you, even if you are within
              this group.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you want to declare yourself as a minority group, please check
            the box. I believe that people should trust each other, so I will
            not ask for proofs on your statement.
          </p>
