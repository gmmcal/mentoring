            Hello! My name is Gustavo Cunha, I have almost 20 years of
            experience developing all sorts of web-based software. I strongly
            believe that teaching is the best way to learn, so I want to
            dedicate some of my time to teach something to you and, in that
            experience exchange, also learn from you.
          </p>

          <h2>Expectations</h2>
          <p>
            In order for everything work well and we can learn together, we need
            to setup some ground rules on what I can offer and you can expect
            from me.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>There is no such thing as a stupid question</strong>. Feel
              free to ask anything and I'll try my best to help you.
            </li>
            <li>
              I will not pair program with you. The idea is to talk about
              development carreer, not write code along with you. Pair
              programming takes much more time and requires previous domain
              knowledge that I might not have enough.
            </li>
            <li>
              I can try to do code review with you. For that, please send a link
              for your repository/(pull|merge) request during your appointment
              and be clear that your want a code-review session.
            </li>
            <li>
              I will not review code that is intended to be submitted for a job
              application. This is not fair to other applicants. If I suspect
              this is the intention, I will stop the session.
            </li>
            <li>
              I can help you prepare for interviews. I've been doing this for
              companies already. But that is no guarantee that you will succeed
              your job application (but I do hope you do).
            </li>
            <li>
              I can review your CV and give you tips on how to improve. Please,
              send a PDF link of your CV and we can talk about it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Don't expect I know everything. I'm here to help you, but also to
              learn from you.

          <h2>Commitment Fee</h2>
          <p>
            I've organized a few events on my life, and one thing I learned is
            that anything that is given for free lacks commitment. To avoid this
            issue, I decided to place what I call a commitment fee.
          </p>
          <h4>Application period</h4>
          <p>
            When applying for a session, please book with 3 business days in
            advance. This will give you and me enough time to process payment,
            check your personal needs and have all details ready for our
            session.
          </p>
          <h4>The Amount</h4>
          <p>
            The amount I charge for this is <strong>&euro;10,00</strong> (ten
            euros). This amount covers one session of 30 minutes.

          <ul>
            <li>I will not process refund for no-shows.</li>
            <li>
              If you can't attend a session, please notify with at least 24
              hours before your session. I will allow you to book a new time
              free of charge.
            </li>
            <li>
              You are allowed to postpone 1 time per session payment. If you
              rebook one session and can't make it, I will not rebook nor
              refund.
            </li>
            <li>
              If <strong>I</strong> need to postpone the session, you will be
              allowed to rebook <strong>two</strong> sessions instead of
              <strong>1</strong>, with no extra costs.
            </li>
            <li>
              You will probably receive an email from Calendly after your
              booking. Please, do not use the cancel nor reschedule links
              provided on the email without my express approval.
            </li>
            <li>
              Any changes for this refund policy will be effective on the day
              the code is published on
              <a href="https://github.com/gmmcal/mentoring/commits/main" target="_blank"
                >Github</a
              >. If your booking was done before that, you will not be eligible
              for it, regardless if you benefit or not by the change.

          <h3>Tech minority commitment</h3>
          <p>
            If you belong to any group that is part of a tech minority, like
            LGBTQA+, woman or people of color, your fee will be refunded after
            the session, if you want, according to the following criteria:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>I have 3 business days to confirm the refund.</li>
            <li>
              I will try to refund you in full minus Wise Transfer Fees. I will
              send you a proof of the transfer via email.
            </li>
            <li>
              Whenever possible, I will try to absorve the fees and return 100%
              of the Commitment Fee. There is no guarantee that this will
              happen, unfortunately.
            </li>
            <li>
              Refunds will only be processed after the session. No-shows and
              reschedule policy still applies to you, even if you are within
              this group.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you want to declare yourself as a minority group, please check
            the box. I believe that people should trust each other, so I will
            not ask for proofs on your statement.
